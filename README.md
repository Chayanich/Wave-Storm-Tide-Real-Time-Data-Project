### About This Project
This project analyzes real-time wave and storm tide data from open Queensland Government sources. It demonstrates data ingestion from APIs, cleaning, visualization, and building risk indices for coastal monitoring.

### Repository Contents

### Problem Statement

Extreme weather events in Queensland create risks for communities, tourism, and infrastructure. The goal was toÂ **capture and analyze wave + storm-tide data in real time**Â to help stakeholders monitor conditions and respond effectively.

---

### Tools & Technologies

- **Python (pandas, matplotlib, plotly)**Â â€“ Data ingestion & analysis
- **Jupyter Notebook**Â â€“ Development & reporting environment

---

### Key Features

- PulledÂ **real-time wave + tide data**
- Processed and cleaned streaming data.
- CreatedÂ **risk indices**Â based on wave height & storm tide thresholds.
- Visualized trends usingÂ **interactive charts**.

---

### Insights & Outcomes

- Identified peak storm surge conditions linked to specific coastal locations.
- Built a framework that can be expanded forÂ **tourism risk planning**Â orÂ **emergency response systems**.
- Showcased integration ofÂ **real-time data streams**Â into analytical workflows.
