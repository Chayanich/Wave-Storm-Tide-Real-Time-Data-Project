This project used the data from open queensland goverment sources. 

### Overview

Developed a **real-time data analysis project** using wave and storm-tide sensor feeds from Queensland. Processed live data via API, built visualizations, and created **risk indices** to assess storm impact on coastal regions.

---

### Problem Statement

Extreme weather events in Queensland create risks for communities, tourism, and infrastructure. The goal was to **capture and analyze wave + storm-tide data in real time** to help stakeholders monitor conditions and respond effectively.

---

### Tools & Technologies

- **Python (pandas, matplotlib, plotly)** – Data ingestion & analysis
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Development & reporting environment

---

### Key Features

- Pulled **real-time wave + tide data**
- Processed and cleaned streaming data.
- Created **risk indices** based on wave height & storm tide thresholds.
- Visualized trends using **interactive charts**.

---

### Insights & Outcomes

- Identified peak storm surge conditions linked to specific coastal locations.
- Built a framework that can be expanded for **tourism risk planning** or **emergency response systems**.
- Showcased integration of **real-time data streams** into analytical workflows.
