A longer `Tp` along with a higher `Hsig`  may suggest that the waves are influenced by a storm occurring far from the shore. This is because waves generated by distant storms tend to travel long distances with relatively consistent energy. As they move away from the storm source, shorter-period waves lose energy and disappear, while longer-period waves continue to travel, arriving at the shore with higher wave heights and longer periods. This pattern is different from locally generated wind waves, which typically have shorter wave periods and are more irregular.\n",

        "I look through the analysis and visualisations and connect them to the initial question in order to gain insights:\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Question**: How do near real-time wave height and tide level data vary at major coastal locations in South East Queensland, and what patterns can be observed through continuous monitoring? How can this information help with flood warnings and infrastructure planning?\n",
        ">\n",
        "### Findings:\n",
        "\n",
        "Wave height and tide data vary by site and time, with clear patterns linked to the geographical location and surrounding environmental features\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Stronger Waves** (`Hsig` x `Tp`) tend to occur at sites further from the shore or those facing the open ocean, indicating an increased risk for coastal impacts like erosion and flooding.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **High tide levels** (`Water Level`) are more common near river mouths or locations with complex waterway systems, which are often in proximity to neighbourhoods and vulnerable infrastructure.\n",
        "\n",
        "The most important finding is that areas with consistently strong waves and/or high tides can be classified as high-risk areas for coastal erosion and flooding.\n",
        "\n",
        "This insight can help prioritise where coastal and/or flood protection infrastructure should be developed first according to urgency and estimated impact, which will help define budget allocation and help with the infrastructure design based on site-specific conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Further Analysis:\n",
        "\n",
        "While working on this assignment, I noticed that wave height and water level patterns might be influenced by daily weather conditions. For instance, on 29th March, there was a noticeable increase in wave activity during rain events, which aligns with weather reports from 29th – 30th March indicating rainfall. This suggests that integrating weather data can add important context to wave and tide analysis (Screenshots of a graph and weather observation from [BOM Website](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/dwo/202503/html/IDCJDW4019.202503.shtml) below).\n",
        "\n",
        "![My Image](data/Picture1.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "Incorporating weather forecast data could improve the ability to predict wave and tide conditions, especially during extreme weather events. This would enhance flood and erosion risk assessments in real time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, exploring seasonal trends and incorporating climate change projections would strengthen long-term planning and provide a more comprehensive understanding of coastal risks.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Limitations and How to Address Them:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Near real-time data provides timely updates but is limited to showing only the last 7 days, lacking the broader historical context needed to understand long-term trends. This limitation can be addressed by integrating historical datasets to identify recurring patterns and trends over time.\n",
        "- The different site locations of these datasets prevent them from being fully combined. Initially, I aimed to create a `scatter_map` to show both datasets simultaneously, allowing users to distinguish between `Storm Tide Data` and `Wave Data`. However, `Plotly Express`’s scatter_map feature does not support using different scatter shapes for two variables. As a result, the data needs to be displayed on separate maps.\n",
        "- Currently, the best approach is to combine all charts into a single dashboard, where users can view and analyze the charts together to monitor the overall coastal situation.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Applications and Recommendations:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Near Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard:** Facilitates continuous monitoring and timely flood warnings for high-risk coastal areas.\n",
        "- **Disaster Management & Early Warning Systems:** Supports better preparation and response during coastal hazard events.\n",
        "- **Coastal Preservation Infrastructure Planning:** Helps prioritise resource allocation in areas vulnerable to flooding or erosion.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Recommendations for Decision-Makers:\n",
        "- Prioritize **offshore-facing sites** for *erosion control*.\n",
        "- Monitor high **tide-prone sites** near rivers for *flood prevention*.\n",
        "- *Focus resources* on **densely populated areas with high risk**."
